In this document, I will include the code for applying GridSearch in R, in order to identify the best "Hyper-Paramaters" to use for any given ML algorithm:

#Install and import the caret library:
library(caret)
classifier = train(form= Purchased ~ ., data = training_set, method = 'svmRadial')
classifier$bestTune

#In the code above, we apply our classifier/estimator with paramaters that would return 
which values for 'C, Accuracy, & Kappa' to use. If you run the last line, classifier$bestTune, it will easily return the best options to use in each situation.
